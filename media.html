			<h4>DUMB</h4>
			<p4>This video is about Yoan a frind who i met on cold but sunny, snowy day in the Balkan mountains. We were both traveling to the top of the mountain that day so we could ski down the slopes. I really liked his outlook on life. All i wanted was to document my frend and i will do this with all my other friends.The irony is that he is not dumb, people like to asume that.How do you mesure stupidity anyway?</p4>
